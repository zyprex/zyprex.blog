understandable and poignant version of a hugely noble ambition the desire to
change other people.</p><p>There is so much we might fairly want to change about them.</p><p>We&rsquo;re an entirely imperfect lot and therefore we want other people to be more
self-aware, punctual, generous, reliable, introspective, resilient,
communicative, profound.</p><p>At home, we want them to focus more on the sink, the children, the bins, the
money and the need to put the phone down and look up.</p><p>At a macro-dimension, we want people to think more about the suffering of
encaged animals the destruction of our habitat and the iniquities of
international capitalism.</p><p><strong>Most of us, very far from our ideal selves.</strong></p><p>And at the level of the species, we come close to an evolutionary error.</p><p>The desire to change people is therefore no pathology.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a clear-sighted recognition of the scale of human wickedness.</p><p>Nagging is, in its essence, an attempt at teaching, at getting an idea for
improvement from one mind into another.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s also a version of teaching that has given up hope.</p><p>It has descended into an attempt to insist rather than invite to coerce rather
than charm.</p><p>One is too panicked by the thought of the unteachable student is ruining one&rsquo;s
life to find the inner resources to see it a little more from their point of
view.</p><p>It&rsquo;s one&rsquo;s own suffering that dominates all the available imaginative capacity.</p><p>And so one gets straight to the point, gets rid of garlands, omits the honey
and says it in plain terms.</p><p>&ldquo;The bins nee attention now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get to the table immediately&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a selfish layabout.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not there, here &mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>One isn&rsquo;t wrong. One is really very right, but also very tired and deep down,
quite sad.</p><p>Lamentably, also, it just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>By the time one start to humiliating the student, the lesson is over.</p><p>Nagging breeds its evil twin, shirking.</p><p>The other pretends to read the paper, goes upstairs and feels righteous.</p><p>The shrillness of one&rsquo;s tone gives them all the excuse they need to trust that
we have nothing kind or true to tell them.</p><p>One changes other people only when the desire that they change has not reached
an insistent pitch, when we can still bear that they remain as they are.</p><p>All of us improve only when we have not been badgered or made to feel guilty,
only when we have a sense that we are loved and deeply understood for the many
reasons why change is so hard for us.</p><p>We know, of course, the bins need our attention, that we should strive to get
to bed earlier and that we have been a disappointment in the couple.</p><p>But we can&rsquo;t to hear these lessons in an unsympathetic tone.</p><p>We want tricky children that we are to be indulged for our ambivalence about
becoming better people.</p><p>The same obtuse dynamic is a play at the political level.</p><p>We know we shouldn&rsquo;t abuse the planet, bend rules or close our hearts to the
unfortunate.</p><p>But we won&rsquo;t do any of the good things if a dour figure wags his finger and
delivers stern lectures.</p><p>We want to be charmed not dragged into goodness.</p><p>The tragedy of nagging is that its causes are usually so noble and yet that it
doesn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>We nag because we feel that our possession of the truth lets us off having to
convey it elegantly.</p><p>It never does.</p><p>The solution to nagging isn&rsquo;t to give up trying to get others to do what we
want.</p><p>Rather, it&rsquo;s to recognise that persuasion always needs to occur in terms that
make sense to those who so badly need to be altered.</p></div><div class=pager><br>▲ <a href=/2021/git-security-change/>Git Security Change</a><br>▼ <a href=/2021/fast-cd-keymap-in-zsh/>Fast Cd Keymap in Zsh</a></div><footer style="text-align:right;margin:5rem .2rem .2rem"><div><section><a class=taxo href=/categories/introspection/>@introspection</a></section></div><div>&copy; 2020 - 2022</div><small>page 2021</small></footer></div><script defer type=application/javascript src=/js/norm.js></script></body></html>
