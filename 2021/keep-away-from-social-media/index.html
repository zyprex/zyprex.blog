you to keep away from social media.</p><p>The first point about social media is the addictiveness.</p><p>Nobody really wants to spend hours and hours every day,
updating their status and seeing what other people think about them.
Nobody consciously wants to do that.</p><p>But those behaviors are themselves-addictive behaviors, what you&rsquo;re
trapped in that loop. It&rsquo;s very hard to break out.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not that we want to go back to some interlink past and Eden before
the machines existed.
It&rsquo;s that we need to take control of these machines and use them for
their proper end.</p><h1 id=the-fact-20-people-not-active-on-social-media>The Fact: 20% People Not Active on Social Media<sup><a class=h__anchor href=#the-fact-20-people-not-active-on-social-media>¶</a></sup></h1><p>The bad thing is that you think people&rsquo;s lives is much more fun than your own life.
When I&rsquo;m on the bus or walk through the street, I just see people like zombies.</p><h1 id=advantages-of-present-face-to-face>Advantages of Present Face to Face<sup><a class=h__anchor href=#advantages-of-present-face-to-face>¶</a></sup></h1><ol><li>you can get the feedback, know either stop right there or tell them more</li><li>you might withhold a certain opinion rather than being kind of rapid-fire</li><li>you can read the nuance more accurately in the air</li></ol><p><strong>The best thing is not to just shoot your mouth off online</strong>, if you want save
you a touch of elegance.</p><p>The thing is the world is real whether we want to believe it or not and it&rsquo;s really
important for us to have a sense of where we are in that world.</p><h1 id=deficiency-of-social-media>Deficiency of Social Media<sup><a class=h__anchor href=#deficiency-of-social-media>¶</a></sup></h1><p>I don&rsquo;t like to use the term &ldquo;social media&rdquo; at the end of the day because it implies
that it&rsquo;s designed to promote social behaviors when usually it&rsquo;s designed to
promote the amount of attention that we&rsquo;re giving it.</p><p>In order to grab our attention because there&rsquo;s so much competition design has to
appeal to the lower parts of us to the kind of non-rational, automatic, impulsive
parts of us, and so this is why we get things like clickbait, like sensationalism
, things that appeal to our outrage.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a whole industry of consultants, psychologists who are are helping
designers really punch the right buttons in our brains, so that we do keep
coming back for more and we do stay hooked on the products.</p><p><strong>Be aware, their advertising system is not really social platforms</strong>.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion<sup><a class=h__anchor href=#conclusion>¶</a></sup></h1><p>Since 63% of the global population (4.8 billion people) is not active
on social media, it&rsquo;s high time to stop overusing your smartphone.</p><p>The things that are the most worthwhile and most fulfilling, is the things
that you take the most work and spend a lot of time on. Those are their
pleasures that are self-actualizing that help you realize a part of yourself
you didn&rsquo;t have.</p></div><div class=pager><br>▼ <a href=/2021/clang-compile-error/>Clang Compile Error</a></div><footer style="text-align:right;margin:5rem .2rem .2rem"><div><section><a class=taxo href=/categories/introspection/>@introspection</a></section></div><div>&copy; 2020 - 2021</div><small>page 2021</small></footer></div><script defer type=application/javascript src=/js/norm.js></script></body></html>
